<h1>Fine Particles (PM 2.5) pose health risks to New Yorkers</h1>
      <!-- SUBHEAD-->
<h4>Fine particles pose threats to vulnerable populations. A large number of the Community Districts in New York City have a PM 2.5 rate above the safety guidelines supported by the World Health Organization. </h4>

  <p>Fine particles are emitted by vehicles, construction sites, boilers in buildings, and other combustions. While New York City's numbers aren’t considered extremely high, the level shown in Midtown in 2022 can pose a risk for individuals with health issues living in the area.</p>

  <p> According to the <a href= "https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240034228"> World Health Organization’s </a> 2021 guidelines for global air quality, “the annual mean guideline value for PM2.5 is 5 µg/m3.” Even short-term exposures to PM2.5 levels above 10 mcg/m3 can be harmful to health.

<p> In September 2023, Mayor Eric Adams released the guidelines for <a href= "https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/656-23/mayor-adams-launches-getting-97-done-comprehensive-mobilization-strategy-reduce-building#:~:text=%22"> Local Law 97 </a>, a new anti-pollution law. The focus of the law is to reduce pollution emitted by NYC buildings. The law passed in 2019, but rules around it were updated recently. </p>

  <!-- EXPERT QUOTE GOES HERE-->
  <p>"Among the stationary sources of air pollution in the United States, buildings—residential and commercial combined—remain the second-highest source of premature mortality related to PM2.5”--- Climate policy impacts on building energy use, emissions, and health New York City local law 97, Salimifard, et al.</p>

  <p> <a href= “https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/nyregion/law-97-building-pollution-nyc.html”> Local Law 97 </a> is under fire for allowing landlords too much time to get away with emitting pollution into the city. Landlords can apply for 2-year extensions if they show good faith in their efforts to reduce emissions. </p>

<p>Changing the amount of pollution buildings are allowed to emit in NYC will directly impact the particle levels across districts. </p>
